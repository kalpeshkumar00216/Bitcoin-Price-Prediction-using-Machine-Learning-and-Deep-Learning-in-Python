# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-in-Python
This project focuses on predicting Bitcoin prices using various Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques in Python. The goal is to analyze historical cryptocurrency data, perform feature engineering, and build predictive models that can forecast future Bitcoin price trends.

**Key Highlights**

- Collected and preprocessed historical Bitcoin price data.

- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and correlations.

- Implemented Machine Learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.) for baseline predictions.

- Built Deep Learning models (LSTM, RNN) to capture time-series dependencies in Bitcoin price fluctuations.

- Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² score.

- Visualized predictions vs. actual prices with Matplotlib and Seaborn.


**Tech Stack**

- Programming: Python

- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Techniques: Time-series forecasting, regression models, deep learning (RNN, LSTM)

**Requirements for the Project**

1. Data Collection

3. Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing values

- Feature engineering (technical indicators: moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc.)

- Normalize/scale data (important for deep learning models like LSTM)

- Split into train/test sets

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Line plots for price trends

- Correlation heatmaps

- Volume vs. Price analysis

- Volatility analysis

5. Modeling Approaches

- Machine Learning Models:

- Linear Regression

- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

- GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)

6. Model Evaluation

- Metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R²

- Compare ML vs. DL performance

- Plot actual vs. predicted prices

7. Visualization & Insights

- Time-series plots of predicted vs. real prices

- Performance comparison graphs

8. Optional Enhancements

- Deploy model with Flask/Streamlit as a web app

- Use Prophet (by Facebook/Meta) for time-series forecasting

- Backtest predictions against real trading strategies
